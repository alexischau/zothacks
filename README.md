Zot Point Average:
UCI WebSOC + Grade Distribution Viewer Integration

Version 0.1 (WIP)

Zot Point Average is a chrome extension meant to be opened with the UCI's Schedule of Classes webpage. After filtering class category or department, when clicking on a highlighted name a modal should appear with the previous class grade distribution alongside the class average GPA. If the grade distribution appears to be blank it can mean that there is no data regarding that professor in the database or the name listed is not a lecture professor. Note there is that there are no pre-Covid or post-Covid selections (as teaching styles and online sections may create variation within grade distribution).
